# Time-Series-Sales-Forecasting
This repository contains an Interactive Dashboard For Predicting Demand using R's forecast package and RShiny. 

Using MNC Sales and Pricing data from retailers, a time-series model was built to predict Sales demand based on historical data. For presentational purposes on GitHub, the original data was randomly generated (for confidentiality reasons). The link to the interactive dashboard can be found here: http://127.0.0.1:7682/
