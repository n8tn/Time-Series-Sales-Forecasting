# Time-Series-Sales-Forecasting
This repository contains an Interactive Dashboard For Predicting Demand using R's forecast package and RShiny. 

Using MNC Sales and Pricing data from retailers, a time-series model was built to predict Sales based on historical data. For confidentiality reasons, I randomized the data between an appropriate range. To predict how demand forecasts change with respect to price, an interactive dashboard was built in RShiny that incorprates sliders for Price and a drop-down menu for Forecast Horizons. The link to the interactive dashboard can be found here: http://127.0.0.1:7682/
